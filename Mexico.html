                                    crime. Crime rates are generally higher in major urban areas. Many cities have distinct areas
                                    where organised criminal groups with links to drug cartels operate. While travellers are
                                    generally not targeted by drug cartels, they face serious risks from collateral violence during
                                    clashes between opposing cartel members, or between criminals and the security forces.

                                    In response to the growing violence perpetrated by drug cartels, then-president Felipe Calderon
                                    (2006-12) deployed the military to confront the issue in 2006. Due to high levels of corruption
                                    in the police force, the newly reformed Federal Police also became a key element in the fight
                                    against drug cartels.

                                    In 2019, president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government created and deployed the
                                    National Guard in an effort to combat organised crime. However, these initiatives have failed to
                                    curb the violence, and drug-related murders have continued to increase. Several regions in
                                    Mexico, especially along the northern border region, have become extremely violent. Violent
                                    cartel-related crime has also risen along the central-west coastline.

                                    rarely targeted in such crimes. However, short-duration 'express' kidnappings pose a risk to

                                    deception and personal information. These incidents are most common in HIGH risk areas and

                                    Street crimes such as pickpocketing and mugging pose a significant risk to foreign business
                                    visitors, particularly in urban areas. Crowded squares, transport terminals, the metro and buses
                                    are favoured targets for pickpockets and bag-snatchers, who often work in teams. Criminals

                                    Robbers particularly target foreigners who appear to be rich, lost and/or drunk, as well as

                                    subsequently robbed; visitors should order drinks at the bar, where their preparation can be
                                    observed, and then not leave them unattended. There have also been occasional reports of the
                                    use of substandard or tainted alcohol by some bars, including in more upscale resorts. If
                                    possible, visitors should request a brand name or higher quality alcohol while ordering a drink,
                                    and only accept food and drinks from staff members in official venue uniforms

                                The judiciary generally lacks efficiency and is marred by corruption and the infiltration of
                                organised crime and drug cartels. The country has several police/security agencies. Increased
                                funding, training from the government and US co-operation initiatives have helped modernise
                                these agencies in recent years. This is especially true for the federal police force, which has a
                                strength of approximately 40,000 and is the main law enforcement body. President Lopez Obrador
                                has overseen the creation and deployment of the National Guard, a new security force which
                                combines federal police, Army and Navy officers into a single contingent which in theory will
                                increase professionalism and decrease corruption. However the force is not without controversy;
                                some federal police are protesting the initiative, claiming that they are not being given equal
                                consideration for promotion opportunities, amongst other complaints.

    Law enforcement agencies continue to struggle with corruption, hampering their ability to combat
    the drug cartels. They are also frequently targeted in attacks by such groups. Furthermore,
    rivalries between the federal and state police forces have affected operational efficiency. The
    government started using military units for anti-narcotics operations in 2006; however this
    change has not reduced the overall level of violence. Members should minimise contact with law
    enforcement officers due to police corruption; instead, travellers should approach their embassy
    or local consulate for assistance in dealing with the local police, and to ensure that crimes are
    registered properly

                                trips of up to 180 days. Foreign nationals entering Mexico to work, provided that their salaries
                                will remain paid by the home country and the period of stay will not exceed 180 days, may do so
                                under the business visitor visa and will be deemed as visitors without permission to engage in

                                territory so long as such activity is legal and honest and there is no legal restriction on it being
                                carried out by foreigners. It is important to specify that business visitors cannot receive any type

                                authorities; the multiple migratory form (FMM) will be sufficient. This visa applies to business
                                visitors with non-lucrative activities, and is valid for 180 days.
